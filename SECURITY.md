# Security Policy


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reports of any security related bugs/issues should be emailed to:

security@onepub.dev

We aim to respond to security related issues within one business day.

Once the bug has been triage we will provide a timeline for the fix to be applied.

We expect triage to take 2-3 business days subject to the complexity of the issue.

Our objective is to fix critical bugs within 24 hours of the triage completion.

Timeline for other bugs will be based on the perceived risk to our customers.

When reporting a bug please provide as much information as possible to help
us reproduce the problem.

It would be a rare exception for us to decline to fix a reported bug, if however we do so, you will be supplied with a reason as to why.
